While the \"Before and After\" analysis (question 2) yielded the highest treatment effect estimate, subsequent analyses using ATE, DiD, and state-specific ATEs (questions 4, 5, and 6) provided more nuanced insights, considering changes over time and variations across states. Considering the statistically significant treatment effects and expected gains, I recommend launching a full-scale marketing campaign targeting all states. The comprehensive analysis suggests a substantial positive impact of the campaign, ensuring a more informed and effective marketing strategy."
